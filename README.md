SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON HUMANS - A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

Social media has become a better part of our lives in today's world. Most of us are
so involved in social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat etc. The
more people are involved the more they face the risk of exposure to the world.
Results of many researches have proven that social media has a higher impact and
influence on people. Social influence plays a prominent role in shaping peopleâ€™s
behavior now-a-days and affecting human decisions in various domains. People's
mental health could have both positive and negative impact due to social media,
some of the negatives might be depression, anxiety, self-harm whereas the
positives might be a feeling that we are not alone in this busy world. Social media
plays an important role in influencing people in their opinions on topics like the
environment, politics, and society. One of the main negatives of social media is
cyberbullying, lack of privacy and security. The main objective of this project is
to show the impact or influence of social media in the form of statistics by
comparing different quantities like different social media sites, number of people
on it, amount of time spent, etc with the help of data visualization and machine
learning techniques.
